    <h2>Hackathon Guide</h2>
    <p>I love hackathons a lot. Although I've only gone to a dozen hackathons and won only a few, I have some things to share from my experiences going to these events, and hope that they help you.</p>
    
    <h3>Team</h3>
    <p>Working with a team and meeting other innovators is my favorite part of a hackathon experience. It may take several hackathons and experiences with different people to help you find your "hackathon buddies" that you may team up with quite frequently for these events, however with each team that you work with, a true bonding experience is forged, as these events really allow you to work deeply with other folks and become more broadened in our understanding of the world we all share.</p>
    
    <h3>Ideating</h3>
    <p>I think one of the best methods for brainstorming is to walk around and think. Oftentimes, your subconscious mind will come up with million dollar ideas if you give it time to think. So I suggest that leading up to your hackathons, you spend some time doing this activity, to allow you to be ready to take on your next hackathon idea.</p>
    <p>Discussing with your peers is also a really great way to identify problems and ideas to work with. There's nothing better than collaboration - we're all learning from each other and the same thing applies to the process of ideas.</p>
    <p>Using LLMs also help with ideating, and allow you to mitigate a lot of time in the brainstorming and planning stages. They can't get you to the finished product, but they will help you locate some of the stepping stones to get there.</p>
    
    <h3>Time Allocation</h3>
    <p>Time is limited at these hackathons. In order to make the best use of it, take some time to think about how you'll go about the 24, 36, or several day time frame that you have to build. Below, we'll talk about some of the things you may be spending time on during your hackathon experience.</p>

    <h4>Sleeping</h4>
    <p>Sleeping is essential for optimal performance. While some teams may push through with minimal rest, knowing your personal limits and getting adequate sleep can lead to better results. I've tried the 2 all-nighters in a row and it just can't work after the second time it hits 12 am - and even before then I notice my productivity could be better with a little sleep.</p>
    
    <h4>Eating</h4>
    <p>A wise friend once told me: <i>"You can call me whatever you'd like, but don't call me late for lunch!"</i> Take advantage of the free food that hackathons provide, and use your lunch time to take a break from coding and spend time enjoying conversation with your teammates or even bring your food outside to enjoy the sunlight and fresh air (and grass).</p>
    
    <h4>Workshops</h4>
    <p>Workshops offer a great opportunity for learning and networking, but it's important to be selective. With limited time, choose workshops that align with your goals and interests. If you're already familiar with a topic, consider skipping that workshop in favor of one that will teach you something new.</p>
    
    <h4>Coding</h4>
    <p>Coding is the heart of a hackathon, but distractions can easily derail your productivity. To stay focused, find an optimal workspace for you and your team. Set specific timeblocks for coding goals, and periodically review your progress to ensure you're on track. If goals aren't being met, reassess your time allocations.</p>
    <p>Start working on your Devpost submission early to avoid last-minute stress. This will also give you time to refine your presentation and ensure your project is well-documented.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>I appreciate you taking the time to read through my thoughts about hackathons. I hope that this information was able to help or provide a new perspective to how you tackle them.
