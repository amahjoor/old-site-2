            We should all be grateful to live in a time where we're able to benefit from revolutionary innovations in technology as well as to learn from the great stories that have tested time. I love how epic it can feel to read a book in the quiet of the night or morning, feeling the paper and in my head about what's shared. The beauty of reading books is that the ideas shared in them sit in your head, and marinate. In a world filled with short-form content, it's nice to ground yourself with chai and chapters.
