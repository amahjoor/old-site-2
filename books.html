            Let us be grateful to live in a time where we can benefit from revolutionary innovations in technology as well as learn from the great stories that have tested time. I love how epic it can feel to read a book in the the night or morning, when it's really quiet and the world is waking up or going to sleep. In a world filled with short-form content, reading is a flex-worthy habit (especially non-fiction and history).

            Below, you can find the books that I am currently reading, am planning on reading, or have finished reading. I'd love to have discussions about any of these books so definitely reach out if you've finished or plan to read any of these.

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>These are some quotes that have stood out to me, from my reads.</p>
        <p><i>"I hear and forget. I see and hear and I remember. However, when I see, hear, and do, I understand and succeed."</i> - unknown poet, See You At The Top</p>
        <p><i>"I consider my ability to arous enthusiasm among my people the greatest assett I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.
            There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious
            to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise."</i> - Charles Schwab [How to Win Friends and Influence People]</p>
        <p><i>"When is the best time to plant an Oak Tree? 5 years ago."</i> - Shawn D. Nelson (but originally from a Chinese proverb) [The Fifth Vital]</p>
        <p><i>"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."</i> - Apple's "Think Different" commercial, 1997 [Steve Jobs]</p>
