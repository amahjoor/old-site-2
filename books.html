    <h1>Books</h1>
    <p>
        I'm grateful to live in our time, where we're able to benefit from the many great innovations of technology, as well as learn from the great stories that have tested time. The beauty of reading books is that the ideas shared in them sit in your head, and marinate. In a world filled with short-form content, it's nice to ground yourself with chai and chapters.
